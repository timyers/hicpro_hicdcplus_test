```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Description

This is an analysis using the HiCDCPlus `R` package.  The input files used came from the output of a HiC-Pro analysis using its included sample data.  The input files are located in the /data folder.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
