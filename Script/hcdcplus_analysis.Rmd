## Description

This is a HiChIP analysis using the HiCDCPlus `R` package.  The input files used came from the output of a HiC-Pro analysis using its included sample data.  The input files are located in the /data folder.

Here I adapt the workflow outlined on the HiCDCPlus github page:
(https://github.com/mervesa/HiCDCPlus#ice-normalization-using-hitc-ice).

I identify significant interactions and differential interactions.



## Finding significant interactions from HiChIP

Load required libraries
```{r load-lib, eval=TRUE}
library(HiCDCPlus)
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
library(DESeq2)
library(HiTC)
```

# Generate Features
```{r features, eval=TRUE}
# define output directory path
out_dir <- "/Users/myersta/Box/Rprojects/hichip/hicpro_hicdcplus_test/Output"

# generate genomic features
construct_features(output_path = paste0(out_dir, "/hg19_5kb_hindiii"),
                   gen = "Hsapiens",
                   gen_ver = "hg19",
                   sig = "AGCTT",
                   bin_type = "Bins-uniform",
                   binsize = 5000,
                   chrs = c("chr21","chr22")
                  )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
